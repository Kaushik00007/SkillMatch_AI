##  Introduction
The **AI-Powered Resume Screening & Ranking System** is an intelligent tool designed to streamline the recruitment process. It enables recruiters to efficiently analyze and rank multiple resumes against a given job description using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** and **cosine similarity**. This ensures an objective and accurate matching of candidates based on relevant skills and experience.

## 🎯 Features
☑️ **Multi-Resume Upload** – Supports batch processing of resumes in PDF and DOCX formats.  
☑️ **TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity** – Ensures accurate ranking based on keyword relevance.  
☑️ **Resume Parsing & Analysis** – Extracts key details such as skills, experience, and certifications.  
☑️ **Graphical Match Comparison** – Visualizes resume ranking with a bar chart.  
☑️ **Bias-Free Hiring (Resume Anonymization)** – Option to hide personal details for unbiased screening.  
☑️ **User-Friendly UI** – Built using **Streamlit** for an intuitive and interactive experience.  
☑️ **Downloadable Reports** – Provides ranked results in CSV format for further analysis.
